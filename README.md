Once you have TypeScript installed, you can clone this repository and start working through the code samples and exercises. If your are in the folders 1-10 you can run your code the following way - in your CLI go the the desired topic/folder and run `tsc -w` to start compiling TypScript and start live server to see the results in your browser.
If your are in the folders 11-12 you can run your code the following way - in your CLI go the the desired topic/folder and run `npm start`. If your are in the folder 13 you can run your code the following way - in your CLI go the the desired topic/folder and run `npm run dev`

## Conclusion :sparkles:
